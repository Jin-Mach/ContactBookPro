The application allows exporting selected or all contacts to Excel format.

Exporting to Excel (.xlsx) saves contacts in a file compatible with Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc, and other spreadsheet applications.
Data is organized into columns, making it easier to edit and analyze.
After choosing the export, a save dialog will appear, which by default saves the file to the Documents folder (same location for Windows and macOS).
The user can choose a different folder or file name.

The export runs in the background, so the application can still be used while saving.

With a large number of contacts, the export may take longer.

Once completed, a pop-up window will inform the user of the successful save.
