The application allows you to search for contacts in two ways â€“ simple and advanced.

Simple Search
Works only in the selected column of the table (for example, Name, Email, Phone). First, select the column in which you want to search.
Enter the text in the search field and click Search. If no column is selected, the application will show a warning "Select a column" and the search will not start.
If you use a suggested match, an exact match is searched; if not, records containing the entered text are searched.

Advanced Search
Clicking on Advanced Search opens a dialog where you can enter multiple conditions at once (for example, Name, City, Email, ...).
For each field, you can choose the option All, Contains, Starts with, or Ends with.
Individual conditions can be modified or deleted without resetting the entire filter.
You can also preview the current filter or save it under a custom name.
Click Search to display results, or a notification if no records match the specified parameters.

Note: Repeated searches only scan contacts limited by the previous filter; to search all contacts, use the "Reset Filters" option.

Saved Filters
Saved filters can be viewed, applied, or deleted at any time.

Reset Filters
Selecting Reset Filters clears all conditions and displays all contacts.
