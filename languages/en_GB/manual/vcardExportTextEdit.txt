The application allows exporting a selected contact as a vCard.

Exporting to the vCard format (.vcf) enables saving contacts in a standardized format supported by mobile phones, email clients (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird), and other contact management applications.
Each exported contact includes basic information â€“ full name, email, phone number, and personal address.
After selecting the export to vCard option, a dialog appears to specify the file location and name.
By default, the dialog opens in the Documents folder (same for Windows and macOS), but the user can choose any other folder.

The export occurs immediately.

Upon completion, a dialog appears informing the user of successful saving.
