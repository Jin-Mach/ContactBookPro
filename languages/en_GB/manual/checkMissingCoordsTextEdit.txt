The application allows you to check contacts without filled coordinates.

The check goes through all contacts and selects those that are missing geographic coordinates based on the provided address.
At the end, either a notification appears stating that no contacts match the criteria, or a dialog shows a list of the found contacts.
In the dialog, you can navigate to a selected contact, which sets the filter to that contact.

The check runs in the background, so the application can still be used during the process.

The user is informed of the completion via a dialog showing the results.

Note: the check only runs with an active internet connection
