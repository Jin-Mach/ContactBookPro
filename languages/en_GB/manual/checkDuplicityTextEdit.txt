The application allows you to check contacts for duplicate information.

The check goes through all contacts and selects those that have the same email addresses, phone numbers, or both.
Duplicate values are searched only in the required contact information (personal, not work-related).
At the end, either a notification appears stating that no contacts match the criteria, or a dialog shows a list of the found contacts.
In the dialog, you can navigate to a selected contact, which sets the filter to that contact.

The check runs in the background, so the application can still be used during the process.

The user is informed of the completion via a dialog showing the results.
