The application allows deleting individual contacts as well as removing all contacts at once.

Deleting a single contact
Select the desired contact in the table and click the delete button.
A confirmation dialog will appear asking "Are you sure you want to delete?" with options to confirm or cancel the deletion.
After confirming, the selected contact will be removed, and a pop-up window will inform you of the successful deletion of the contact.

Deleting all contacts
No selection is needed â€” simply click the button to delete the entire database.
A confirmation dialog will open with a text field where you must type the word "delete" to confirm the action.
In this dialog, there is also an option to remove saved filters.
If this option is checked, all saved filters will also be deleted.
After confirming, the application will attempt to delete all contacts from the database, remove saved filters (if selected), and delete the database file (contacts_db.sqlite).
If the database file cannot be deleted, only its contents will be cleared, and the file will remain.
The application will then automatically restart and create a new empty database.

!!! Do not manually delete the database file, as this will cause irreversible data loss !!!
