The application allows previewing a selected contact or a list of contacts in a separate window.

The preview of a selected contact contains all available information except for coordinates, date added, and date of last modification.
In the bottom-right corner, there is a small QR code with the same data that can be exported to vCard format.
The user can zoom in, zoom out, and save the preview as a PDF.
Clicking save opens a dialog to select the file location and name, which by default is saved to the Documents folder (the same for both Windows and macOS).

It is also possible to preview a list of currently displayed contacts or all contacts in the database.
This list includes only first name, last name, gender, relationship, email, phone, and the full address.
The list can also be zoomed in, zoomed out, and saved as a PDF.

PDF preview generation runs in the background, allowing the application to be used while the PDF is being generated.
