The Contact Database application provides a clear and easy way to manage your contacts.

It allows you to record both basic and additional information about contacts, search for them, filter, and export to formats such as CSV, Excel, or vCard.
A preview of contacts in PDF format and display of QR codes for individual entries is also available.

The application includes contact visualization on a map, clear statistics on stored data, and a comprehensive manual to help you use all available features effectively.

The application automatically adapts to your system language (if it is not supported, a dialog will appear allowing you to choose).
It also checks language files, icons, and fonts and updates them if necessary.

Note: Some features are only available with an active internet connection.
