The Contact Database application is designed for clear and easy management of your contacts.

It allows you to record basic and additional information about contacts, search for them, filter them, and export them to formats such as CSV, Excel, or vCard.
A preview of contacts in PDF format and display of QR codes for individual entries is also available.

The application includes visualization of contacts on a map, clear statistics on stored data, and a comprehensive manual to help you effectively use all available features.

The application tracks public holidays for the selected language. If there is a holiday on a given day, a small notification appears in the status bar, allowing you to open a dialog with detailed information.

The application automatically adapts to your system language (if not supported, a dialog with a selection option will be displayed).
It also checks language files, icons, and fonts and updates them if necessary.
This check occurs every time the application starts and may take a few seconds (depending on internet speed).
If files are missing and there is no internet connection, the application will report an error and close.
