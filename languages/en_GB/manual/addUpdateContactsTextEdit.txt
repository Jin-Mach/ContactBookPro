Validation and error messages
If required fields are missing, the work address is incomplete, or the email/phone format is incorrect, an error message will be displayed.
The cursor automatically focuses on the first invalid input.
If, when saving a new contact or editing an existing one, a contact with the same email or phone number already exists in the database, a dialog will appear showing the duplicates found.
In this dialog, the new contact can be saved despite being a duplicate, saving can be canceled, or you can navigate to the selected existing contact shown in the list.

After completion, a pop-up window will appear with information about the successful saving/deletion of the contact.

Obtaining coordinates
After adding a new contact, the application will attempt to automatically obtain its geographic coordinates (based on the address in the required fields).
If the coordinates are found, the contact will be displayed on the map.
If the coordinates cannot be determined, the contact will be saved without coordinates.
The application also includes an automatic check that runs once, five minutes after the application starts.
This check attempts to add coordinates based on the stored address for all contacts that do not have them.
Each contact without coordinates is checked this way a maximum of 20 times.

Note: An active internet connection is required; if no connection is available, coordinates are not verified, but the contact will still be added/edited.

Keyboard shortcuts
New contact: Ctrl + N (macOS: Cmd + N)
Update contact: Ctrl + U (macOS: Cmd + U)

Note: Keyboard shortcuts work only if the application is set to the "Contacts" window.
