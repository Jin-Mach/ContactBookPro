The context menu provides quick access to selected functions for the highlighted contact.
It opens by right-clicking on a contact row in the table.
It allows you to open or edit a contact, delete it, copy information to the clipboard, export to CSV, Excel, or vCard,
preview the contact in PDF or its QR code, and run checks for birthdays, duplicates, or contacts without coordinates.
