The manual is divided into chapters, which are listed in the left panel as a table of contents.

Clicking on a topic in the left list displays the corresponding section of the manual on the right.

Some topics have subtopics beneath them, which can be clicked to view more detailed information.

When you select a tab on the right from the left list, the topic you are currently reading is automatically highlighted in the left panel.

This setup allows you to quickly find the information you need and easily navigate between different sections of the manual.
