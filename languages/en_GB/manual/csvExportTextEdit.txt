The application allows exporting selected or all contacts to CSV format.

Exporting to CSV (.csv) saves contacts as a text file, with individual fields separated by a comma or semicolon (depending on system settings).
This format is suitable for importing into spreadsheet applications (e.g., Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc) or other applications that support CSV.
After selecting the export, a save file dialog appears, which by default saves the file to the Documents folder (same location for Windows and macOS).
The user can choose a different folder and file name.

The export runs in the background, so the application can still be used while saving.

With a larger number of contacts, the export may take longer.

Upon completion, a pop-up window appears, informing the user of a successful save.
